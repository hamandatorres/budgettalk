## Files That Were Empty and Restored:

- ✅ `src/App.css` - Main application layout and styling
- ✅ `src/components/Arena.css` - Battle arena, party groups, fighter selection

## Restored Functionality:

1. **Main App Layout**: Blue gradient background, pixel-perfect title styling
2. **Arena Component**: Party dropdowns, council member selection boxes, battle arena
3. **Leaderboard**: Table layout with proper rankings and hover effects
4. **Battle System**: Fighter selection, battle buttons, result display
5. **Modal Forms**: Add council member form with avatar selection grid
6. **Notifications**: Toast messages with slide-in animations

## Visual Elements Restored:
